			<h3>About Our Lady' Legion</h3>
			<p>Our Lady's Legion is an organized group of Traditional Catholics who are seeking to return Traditional Catholicism to the secular world and restore the Old Christendom.</p>
			<p>We work through <em>Ora et Labora</em> (Pray and Work). We believe the best way to spread the Faith to others is to live our Faith through example and actions, by taking up public space anywhere we can. Whether that be a Rosary Rally or being a relief group to those in need.</p>
			<p>We are asking both Men and Women of the Faith to help aid us to the best of their abilities.</p><br>
			<p>You can contact us by sending an email to: <a href="mailto:OurLadysLegion@gmail.com">OurLadysLegion@gmail.com</a></p>
